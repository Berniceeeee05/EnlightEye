      <h2>KFC Chicken are genetically engineered</h2>
      <p>In 2016, there is a story mentioning that KFC began to inject their livestock full of hormones and altered them into no breaks and feathers, making them grow multiple wings. This allows KFC to save money and raise the size of their chickens. Then, KFC initiated a legal action against the companies, accusing them of slander, and emerged victorious in the lawsuit. Also, KFC issued a press release to public to clarify their suppliers are well known companies such as Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson’s.</p>
