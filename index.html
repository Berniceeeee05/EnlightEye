            <h1 align="center"> Overview</h1>
            <p align="center">
                With the rapid growth of online social networks, 
                it has become one of the main sources for people to receive news and information. 
                According to the <u><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2023/dnr-executive-summary">Digital News Report 2023</a></u> from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism,
                <strong>only 22%</strong>  of people prefer to directly use news websites or apps as the main way of receiving news. 
                While most young adults around the globe prefer social media access.
                However, unlike professional publication sites such as the New York Times, 
                the credibility of the information is doubted. Social media information has strong interactivity, fast dissemination speed, low production and use threshold, and wide coverage.
                The gatekeeping level for authenticity and accuracy is relatively low. 
                Thus, it is important for us to <strong>determine, distinguish, and filter</strong> 
                the information we receive in our daily lives.

            <h1 align="center">Rumors</h1>

                <p> Rumors are pieces of information or stories that are circulated among people, 
                    often through words of mouth or via communication channels such as social media. 
                    Rumors typically involve unverified and unconfirmed information that may be exaggerated. 
                    They spread quickly and widely. 
                    Potentially influence public opinion, create confusion and impact people involved.

            <h1 align="center">Fake News</h1>

                <p> With the growth of social media, 
                    information is flooded nowadays. 
                    Fake news, defined as the purposeful presentation of false or misleading statements 
                    as news, where these are misleading by design by <u><a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/informallogic/2018-v38-n1-informallogic04379/1057034ar.pdf">Gelfert (2018)</a></u>. 
                    Both <u><a href="https://www.globacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Zhang-_-Ghorbani-2020.pdf">Zhang & Ghorbani (2020)</a></u> and <u><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07903.pdf">Lazer et al. (2018)</a></u> agree that fake news 
                    intends to spread misleading information to the public.

            <h1 align="center">Misinformation</h1>

                <p>Misinformation is incorrect or misleading information. 
                    Sometimes all it takes is a simple reporting error.
                     At other times, clickbait headlines and facts taken out of context are used to intentionally inflate disinformation content, 
                     making it more difficult to ignore and trying to convince readers of false information. 
                     At first, definitions of disinformation focused on claims that were obviously untrue, incorrect or lacking in factual accuracy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Online misinformation is spreading. 
                    Moreover, with the help of new technologies, 
                    anyone may now significantly alter images and movies to create a reality that doesn't actually exist.
                </p>

            <h1 align="center">Disinformation</h1>
            
                <p>Disinformation is fake and false information that is shared deliberately and intentionally to harm a person, social group, organization, or country 
                    <u>(<a href="https://rm.coe.int/information-disorder-report-november-2017/1680764666">Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9910783/">Aïmeur et al., 2023)</a></u>.
                    In other words, disinformation is shared intentionally to mislead the readers. It is a type of fake news and information disorder.

            <h1 align="center">Why We Should Care</h1>

            <h3>Personal decision Making</h3>

                <p> Accurate information is needed for making decisions in our lives such as 
                    personal relationships, financial matters, and health choices. 
                    Rumors, fake news, misinformation, and disinformation may mislead us to make poor and wrong discussions, 
                    leading to wrong consequences.
                </p>

            <h3>Reputation</h3>

                <p>False information and rumors may harm the reputation and identity. 
                    In the age of social media and online platforms, 
                    misinformation can quickly spread to others and damage the image of us, affecting our personal relationship and overall social standing.
                </p>

            <h3>Social Cohesion</h3>

                <p>Rumors, fake news, misinformation, and disinformation 
                    may contribute to social division in society. 
                    When false information is spread out, 
                    it will create bias and deepen ideological divides and create conflicts between different groups. 
                    Leading to social fragmentation.
                </p>

            <h3>Trust in institutions</h3>

                <p>Media, government, and organization need to build trust towards the public. 
                    However, when people receive false and misleading information from Media, government, and organization, skepticism and confidence. 
                    This can be a long term implication for societal stability and cooperation.
