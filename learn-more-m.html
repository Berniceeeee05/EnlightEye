            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>
                In the digital world of today, misinformation is an urgent issue due to the speed and ease with which data can be communicated. 
                It may have far-reaching effects on opinions of others, individual beliefs, and even important decisions and behaviors.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are several reasons why misinformation can spread widely and rapidly. 
                Usually people share false information accidentally because they are unaware of it or don't think deeply about the content they come across. 
                Some might disseminate false information on purpose in order to further their own objectives, manipulate public opinion, or create chaos and confusion.
            </p>

            <p>
                In surroundings lacking fact-checking, verification, or critical thinking, misinformation can flourish. 
                In order to gain traction, it frequently takes advantage of emotional reactions, pre-existing beliefs, and cognitive biases. 
                In addition, by promoting captivating or dramatic content without confirming its accuracy, search engine and social media algorithms might help in the quick spread of misinformation.

            <h3>Impact of misinformation</h3>

            <p>
                Fake news can spread on social media up to ten times more quickly than accurate reporting, according to MIT researchers. 
                Corrections to explosive, false posts never receive the same amount of views or credibility when they go viral. 
                The shocking "fact" that grabs listeners' attention is more compelling, memorable, and louder than a follow-up correction. 
                The interesting story prevails when it comes to the race between the false but interesting and the true but boring.

            <h3>Misconception of misinformation</h3>

            <p>
                Misinformation is often misunderstood, one of the misconceptions is that fake news and misinformation are the same thing. 
                Although fake news is a type of misinformation, not all misinformation falls under the category of fake news. 
                Any erroneous or faulty information, regardless of its source or purpose, is referred to as misinformation. 
                It might consist of false statements, edited photos or videos, hoaxes, rumors, and conspiracy theories. 
                The term "fake news" particularly describes made-up news pieces or tales that are passed off as true.
