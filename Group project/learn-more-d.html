            <h3>New Form of Disinformation</h3>

            <p>Disinformation exists in propaganda and malicious content such as hoaxes and phishing. 
               The contents mainly appear in the form of deceptive titles, false in-text content, malicious distortion of picture facts, etc.
            </p>

            <p>A synthetic media <strong>Deepfake</strong> has gained attention since 2017. 
                With the portmanteau of "Deep learning" and "Fake", AI deep learning technology can synthesize images, videos, 
                or even sounds of a person. The most common application is to superimpose an existing image or video onto the target image or video. 
                Through the Generative Adversarial Network, an artificial human face is created, and the manipulated human actions are optimized. 
                Both are under high authenticity. People's faces, especially celebrities', can easily be used without their knowledge. Pornographic videos are the major abuse of Deepfake. 
                It may also be used to create authentic imposter images or videos to harm celebrities. Therefore, it can become a carrier of disinformation.
