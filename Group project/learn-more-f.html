                <h3>2016 US Presidential Campaign</h3>

                    <p>One of the greatest threats to democracy, 
                        journalism, and freedom of speech nowadays is thought to be fake news. 
                        Among the most well-known instances of fake news is the 2016 US presidential campaign,
                        which is pointed out by many that it has been influenced by fake news on social media.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to <u><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook">Silverman (2016)</a></u>,
                        Ironically, during that time, <strong>8,711,000 </strong>shares, 
                        reactions, and comments were posted on Facebook by the top twenty false election stories that were discussed the most. 
                        This is more than the 7,367,000 comments posted on the top twenty election stories published by 19 major news websites in comparison. 
                        The average American was estimated to have come across <strong>1 to 3</strong> fake news stories in the month leading up to the election by
                        <u><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.2.211">Allcott & Matthew (2017)</a></u>analyzing the spread of a set of well-known fake news stories.
                    </p>

                    <p>Given the widespread usage of  phones these days and how much time people spend using them, 
                        it is apparent that fake news is very common on social media and travels quickly.
                        Since this incident has happened, 
                        the phrase fake news has also become commonly used in the public eye and people started to pay more attention to it

                <h3>Prevalence and Impacts of Fake News</h3>

                    <p>Beyond political impacts, 
                        fostering radicalism to escalating cynicism and indifference is another main influence of fake news too 
                        <u><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07903.pdf">(Lazer et al., 2018)</a></u>. 
                        For instance, if a business is seen to be treating its workers badly, 
                        the public may assault it, stage protests, etc. Individuals act radical in the name of justice, which they are actually not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, <u><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102474">Velichety and Shrivastava (2022)</a></u> 
                        use a Twitter dataset to create and apply a two-stage Bayesian Vector Autoregression method to test the mechanisms of social media. 
                        Over ten days, falsehood causes a loss of about 2.11 million USD, but only 67.17 million falsity tweets can combine with ambiguity to cause a loss of 10 million USD. 
                        Regarding the effect of fake news on these platforms, we should learn how to deal with fake news.

        <h3>Misconception of Fake News</h3>

            <p>Lastly, some claim that fact-checks of fake news usually backfire, which is a misconception. 
                According to New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, 
                Fact-checking is not effective because people may hold onto false beliefs more tenaciously than ever in the face of factual corrections that challenge their preconceived notions. Similarly, USA Today wrote in 2019, 
                “When you encounter facts that don’t support your idea, your belief in that idea actually grows stronger.” 
                However, <u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-misinformation/2020/11/06/b28f2e94-1ec2-11eb-90dd-abd0f7086a91_story.html">Nythan (2020)</a></u> points out that evidence has shown that people's opinions tend to be more accurate when they are exposed to fact-checks and other corrective information and the backfire effects are believed to be rare.
            </p>

            <p>To sum it up briefly, 
                fake news has a significant amount of power and spread. 
                We ought to use greater caution and refrain from accepting information at face value without verifying its source. 
                Only by doing this can you ensure that you can be closest to the truth and not be blinded.
